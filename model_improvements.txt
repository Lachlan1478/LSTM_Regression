Hyperparameter tuning: You can try to fine-tune the hyperparameters of your model such as the number of hidden units, learning rate, dropout rate, etc. You can use techniques such as grid search or random search to find the best hyperparameters.

Data preprocessing: You can try different data preprocessing techniques such as normalization, standardization, or scaling to improve the performance of your model.

Model architecture: You can try different architectures such as stacked LSTMs, bidirectional LSTMs, or ConvLSTMs to see if they perform better on your dataset.

Feature engineering: You can try to engineer new features or extract more relevant features from your dataset to improve the performance of your model.

Regularization: You can try to add regularization techniques such as dropout, L1, or L2 regularization to reduce overfitting and improve the generalization performance of your model.
